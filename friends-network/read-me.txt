1) this is only a javascript application. no ui. just a back-end.


2) you can run it like => npm start

   or if your main application is main.js  =>  node main.js

3) there is file named friendship.txt like this:

kamran:tina,amir,sarah,ilan
tina:kamran,kiana,mamad,jafar,amy,shayan
shayan:tina,amy,mateo,kamran
amy:glen,jona,hasan
sarah:jafar,tina,james

a hint is that you can use fs to read files. if you remember it was not working on front-end but it works in back-end. if you don't want to "npm install fs" you can also use javascripts low levelr readfile things.


4) you have to read this file and write a function to answer these kind of questions for now: who are the nth level friend of a person.


a fucntion that returns first, second, ... level of persons friends
